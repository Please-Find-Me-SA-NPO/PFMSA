Search and rescue efforts in South Africa for our missing

Please Find Me SA is an App to assist the public and the Law Authority to Communicate with regards to a crime in action such as a kidnapping or trafficking taking place. This Team will be existing for three years in August 2021. None have any unique skills, yet all have unique hearts. We seek assistance to complete the building of our plain act, as the Law Authority involved is standing by for the creation and birth of the Application that will contribute majorly to cutting down stats on the crime rate in South Africa. NPO Created in the memory of the search of her own Son, Tanya reached out to the Github family and welcomed home.
